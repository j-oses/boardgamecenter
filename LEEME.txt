Changes in the practica4 package:
- Now before generating valid moves it checks if the board is full to optimize.
- Fixed a bug where nextPlayer entered on an infinite loop with a full board.
    - This was done originally because the normal program flow stops before calling nextPlayer if the board is full.
      However, the minMax algorithm may call nextPlayer even with a full board.

Changes in the practica5 package:

Comments about the practica6 code:
- Really intelligent AI player test results:
    - The AI player is almost flawless (100% winrate) against the mildly intelligent AI player but averages around 85%
      winrate against the random player.
    - We think this is consequence of how a minmax algorithm works: the really intelligent player plays as if the other
      player is going to do the optimal move. The mildly intelligent moves are approximately optimal by the really
      intelligent algorithm, but the random moves are not nearly optimal. For this reason, the random player does
      sometimes "surprise" the really intelligent player.
