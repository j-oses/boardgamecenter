Changes in the practica4 package:
- Now before generating valid moves it checks if the board is full to optimize.
- Fixed a bug where nextPlayer entered on an infinite loop with a full board.
    - This was done originally because the normal program flow stops before calling nextPlayer if the board is full.
      However, the minMax algorithm may call nextPlayer even with a full board.
- Fixed several cases of '==' instead '.equals'

Changes in the practica5 package:
- We added a couple of safety checks in BoardJPanel to prevent a crash when deselecting cells that doesn't exist yet.
- Fixed several cases of '==' instead '.equals'
- Made the controller quite cleaner.
- Now the addGameWindowForPieces method in VisualController takes an extra argument: an Observable<GameObserver>. This
  is to prevent registering necessarily in a Game. Now you can choose in what Observable to register.
- Implemented some suggestions on the correction:
    - Antialiasing & small margin when painting.
