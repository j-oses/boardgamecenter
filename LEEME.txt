Changes in the practica4 package:
- Now before generating valid moves checks if the board is full to optimize.
- Fixed a bug where nextPlayer entered on an infinite loop with a full board.
    - This was done originally because the normal program flow stops before calling nextPlayer if the board is full.
      However, the minMax algorithm may call nextPlayer even with a full board.
